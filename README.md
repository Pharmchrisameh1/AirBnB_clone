AirBnB_ clone
Project Description:
This project is focused on creating an AirBnB cloneâ€”a web-based platform that connects travelers with hosts offering accommodations for rent. The clone will incorporate essential features of the original AirBnB site, such as user authentication, property listings, booking management, and reviews.

Command Interpreter Description:
The command interpreter is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for managing and interacting with the AirBnB clone project. It enables users to perform a range of actions, including creating, updating, and deleting objects like users, properties, amenities, and bookings. Additionally, it allows for searching and filtering listings, managing reservations, and accessing user profiles.
